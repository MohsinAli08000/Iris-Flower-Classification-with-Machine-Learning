# 🌺 Iris Flower Classification with Machine Learning

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is part of my **Code Alpha Internship**, where I developed a machine learning model to classify iris flowers based on their features. The objective was to implement **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning algorithms** to achieve accurate classification.
